# Enterprise Roadmap for RAG_HEITAA

This document outlines potential enhancements to turn **RAG_HEITAA** into a production-ready platform. These ideas are not yet implemented but serve as a guide for future development.

## Scalable Backend Architecture
- **Containerization**: Provide Docker images with Qdrant pre-configured to ensure consistent deployments.
- **Async Processing**: Offload heavy ingestion or document parsing to asynchronous tasks (e.g., Celery or FastAPI background jobs).

## Extensible Modular Design
- **Pluggable Components**: Standardize interfaces for embeddings, language models, and vector stores so new providers can be swapped in easily.
- **Multi-Strategy Retrieval**: Combine vector search with keyword or metadata filtering for improved accuracy.

## Enterprise-Grade APIs
- **REST/GraphQL Endpoints**: Expose RAG features via FastAPI with authentication (JWT/OAuth).
- **Versioned APIs**: Maintain backward compatibility through explicit versioning.

## Robust Observability
- **Structured Logging**: Include correlation IDs in `utilities/logger.py` for better tracing. **(Completed)**
- **Centralized Metrics**: Integrate Prometheus/Grafana dashboards for performance monitoring.

## Data Governance & Security
- **Audit Trails**: Log document ingest/edit events with user attribution.
- **Access Control**: Implement fine-grained permissions tied to an identity provider.
- **Encryption**: Use TLS for vector store communication and encrypt sensitive data at rest.

## Enterprise Integrations
- **Webhooks & Event Bus**: Emit events for document ingestion, retrieval, and chat interactions.
- **Workflow Hooks**: Allow custom pre/post-processing steps via a plugin mechanism.

## Data Ingestion Pipelines
- **Batch & Streaming Ingest**: Extend ingestion scripts to handle large batches and streaming sources like S3 or message queues.
- **Metadata Enrichment**: Support adding custom metadata during ingestion for better search and filtering.

## UI & Collaboration
- **Central Dashboard**: Provide a web UI for monitoring ingestion status, chat logs, and retrieval metrics.
- **Versioned Knowledge Bases**: Track document versions for easy rollback and comparison.

## Testing & CI/CD
- **Unit & Integration Tests**: Expand `tests/` to cover each module and run via continuous integration.
- **Automated Deployment**: Offer CI/CD scripts to build, test, and deploy the system.

## Documentation & Samples
- **API Reference**: Publish an OpenAPI specification and example notebooks.
- **Enterprise Setup Guide**: Document staging/production deployment best practices.
